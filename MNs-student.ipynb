    "In this notebook we will develop a Markov Network (MN) class and some of the key algorithms for MNs. \n",
    "\n",
    "An MN combines an _undirected graph_ and a collection of _factors_, and we have coded graphs and factors (specifically, tabular factors) for you. We also provide some of the code for an MN class, and you will complete the rest of it.\n",

    "This is a high-level outline of the notebook, you will find exercises in most sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We start with constructing graphs.\n",
    "2. Next, we construct tabular factors.\n",
    "3. Then, we design an MN class combining a graph and a collection of tabular factors, this class will support all three fundamental probability queries (joint, marginal and conditional).\n",
    "4. We then look into reasoning.\n",
    "5. Finally, we test for independence using the MN structure.\n",
