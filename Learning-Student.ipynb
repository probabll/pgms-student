    "\n",
    "To make the learning process concrete, we'll use **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** as our example. HMMs are a special type of Bayesian network that model sequences where we observe one sequence and want to predict another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an HMM?\n",
    "\n",
    "An HMM models the joint distribution of two sequences of the same length:\n",
    "- **Observed sequence** $X = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$: what we can see\n",
    "- **Hidden sequence** $Y = (y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n)$: what we want to predict\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in part-of-speech (POS) tagging:\n",
    "- $X$ is a sequence of words: \"the cat sat\"\n",
    "- $Y$ is a sequence of POS tags: \"DET NOUN VERB\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The HMM makes two key assumptions:\n",
    "1. **Markov assumption**: Each hidden state $H_i$ depends only on the previous hidden state $H_{i-1}$\n",
    "2. **Independence assumption**: Each observation $O_i$ depends only on the corresponding hidden state $H_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint probability is:\n",
    "$$P(X=x, Y=y) = \\prod_{i=1}^n P(H_i=y_i|H_{i-1}=y_{i-1}) P(O_i=x_i|H_i=y_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n = |x|$ is the length of the sequence. We assume the parent of the first hidden variable $H_1$ is always some fixed value such as $H_0=h^0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameter Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "HMMs use **parameter sharing**: all transitions $P(H_i|H_{i-1})$ share the same parameters (a transition table), and all emissions $P(O_i|H_i)$ share the same parameters (an emission table). This makes learning more efficient and allows the model to generalize to sequences of any length.\n"
