    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will look at extracting different assignments from the PGMs in an efficient way. We do this in two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first part we want to extract the assignment that gives the highest probability (a.k.a. the mode) given certain conditionals and evidence. We do this through a Max-Product version of Variable Elimination (VE).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second part we will extract assignments randomly, where the probability of extraction is based on the probability of the assignment in the model. This is just a complicated way to say that we will do sampling. We will learn how to sample efficiently from a PGM through the Gibbs sampling algorithm, a simple sampling algorithm that makes use of the graphical structure to avoid constructing large factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an example of reasoning w.r.t. a medical diagnosis to build up the intuition and the methods. We will apply the methods to a toy language generation example.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We start with constructing the BN (DAG + CPD) (similar to last week)\n",
    "2. We will implement and reason about naive (arg)max inference for probability queries\n",
    "3. Next, we will implement and reason about the Max-Product VE algorithm \n",
    "4. We will implement gibbs sampling and compare it to the exact case\n",
    "5. We will check whether convergence/mixing actually happens\n",
    "6. We will look at calculating expectations using samples\n",

    "## Mixing / Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "When we start a Gibbs sampler from an initial assignment, the first few samples are typically not representative of the target distribution. The sampler needs time to \"forget\" its starting point and explore the state space according to the PGM's joint distribution. This process of transitioning from the initial state to sampling from the stationary distribution is called _mixing_ or _convergence_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of initial samples that should be discarded (called the _burn-in_ period) depends on how quickly the chain converges. In practice, we often need to run the sampler for many iterations before the samples become representative of the target distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approaches to Assess Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches to assess convergence, each with different applicability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comparing to the target distribution**: For small, tractable PGMs where we can compute the exact joint distribution, we can directly measure how close our Gibbs samples are to the target distribution using metrics like Total Variation Distance (TVD). As we run more iterations, the empirical distribution of our samples should get closer to the true distribution, and the TVD should decrease toward 0. This is the gold standard when available, but it's only feasible for toy examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you have (more or less) already done this in an earlier exercise when we were working with the medical BN!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple chain diagnostics**: For larger PGMs where computing the exact distribution is intractable, we use multiple chain diagnostics. The idea is to run several independent chains (each starting from a different initial assignment) and check if they are sampling from the same distribution. If chains have converged, they should all be exploring the same region of the state space, and statistics computed across chains should be similar. If chains haven't converged, they might be stuck in different modes or regions, leading to different statistics. By monitoring how R-hat changes over iterations and for different burn-in periods, we can assess whether the chains have mixed and determine an appropriate burn-in period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***R-hat (Gelman-Rubin statistic)***\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common diagnostics is the **R-hat** (or $\\hat{R}$) statistic, also known as the Gelman-Rubin statistic. It compares the variance within chains to the variance between chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R-hat ≈ 1.00-1.05**: Good mixing (usually adequate for PGM use)\n",
    "- **R-hat > 1.1**: Chains not yet mixing; probably stuck in different energy basins\n",
    "- **R-hat >> 1.1**: Very poor mixing or chains starting from very different modes\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the log unnormalized probability of each sample as the statistic to monitor. This is a scalar value that summarizes each sample and should converge across chains if mixing is good."
